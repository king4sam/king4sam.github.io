# 4-33 Json and object literal

- 用xml傳送資料會有多餘且重複的字
- 嘿~, js object literal 拿來送資料好像不錯用噢~
- property name "must" be quoted in JSON(In object literal, it could be quoted )
- JSON is technically a subset of object literal syntax
-> valid json is also valid js object literal syntax
- JSON is so popular that js has utilities to tranfer between the two.(JSON.stringtify, JSON.parse)
