# 3-19 Types and javascript

## **bigword alert : Dynamic typing**
- you don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds
- it figures it out while your code is running

# 3-20 Primitive types

## **bigword alert : Primitive type**
- a type of data that represents a single value
- (not a object)

## List of primitive types in javascript

1. undefined
  lack of existence(note that you shouldn't set avariable to this)

2. null
  lack of existence(you can set a variable to this)

3. boolean
  true or false

4. number
  floating point number

5. string
  sequence of characters

6. symbol
  new feature in ES6, ç•¥


# 3-21 Operators

## **bigword alert : operator**
- a special function that is syntactically (written) differently

``` javascript add operator

var a = 4 + 3;

```

- recall : postfix, prefix, infix

# 3-22 Operator precedence and associativity
[operator precedence and Associativity table](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

## **bigword alert : operator precedence**
- which operator function get called first
- higer precedence wins

## **bigword alert : associativity**
- when function have the same precedence, what order operator function get called in
- left-to-right or right-to-left

``` javascript precedence and associativity

var a = 4 + 3 * 5;
// precedence

var b = 4, var c = 5;
a = b = c;
// associativity

```

# 3-24 Coercion

## **bigword alert : Coercion**
- converting a value from one type to another

``` javascript Coercion

var a = 1
var b = '2';

/* bunch of codes */

console.log(a+b);

```

# 3-25 Comparison operator

[Comparsion result table](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness)

- Recalls : associativity, operator, coercion

``` javascript try it out

console.log(3 < 2 < 1);

/*
3 < 2 < 1 //associativity
false < 1 //coercion
0 < 1 //operator
true

 */

Number(undefined) // NaN
Number(null) // 0

```

``` javascript weird equal operator

'3' == 3 //true
false == 0 //true
null == 0 //false, what!?
"" == 0 //true
"" == false //true

```

- In javascript, == will do coercion
- Strict equality (===) is going to save your life !!
- 99% of the time, use ===

# 3-27 Existence adn Booleans


``` javascript how coercion could be useful

Boolean(undefined); //false
Boolean(null); //false
Boolean(''); //false
Boolean(0) //false
var a;

/*goes internet and looks for a value*/

// a is coercion to boolean
// if a could be 0, addtional comparsion is need
if (a || a === 0){
  console.log('Something is there.');
}

```
